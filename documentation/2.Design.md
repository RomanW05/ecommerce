## Architecture
    The E-commerce Web App follows a modern, microservices-based architecture that provides a flexible and scalable platform for online shopping. The app is built using the following technologies:

    * Django Rest Framework: A modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python. Django provides high performance, validation, and easy-to-use asynchronous support.
    * Kafka: A distributed streaming platform that enables real-time communication between services. Kafka provides scalable and fault-tolerant messaging, making it ideal for building microservices architectures.
    * PostgreSQL: A powerful and reliable relational database management system. PostgreSQL provides a flexible data model, transaction support, and advanced features such as JSON storage and full-text search.

    The Web application e-commerce consists of the following microservices:

    * Backend Service: Manages the interactions with the user and displays all the information. Provides the endpoints, APIs and allows interaction
    * Inventory Service: Manages and tracks the inventory levels of each product. Provides operations for updating inventory levels and interacts with the Order Service.
    * Order Service: Manages payments of the order placement and fulfillment process. Provides operations for placing orders, tracking order and status.
    * User Service: Manages user authentication and authorization. Provides operations for registering, logging in, and managing user accounts.
    * Marketing Service: Manages marketing campaigns and product discounts. Provides mechanisms for users to benefit from the different companys strategies.
    * Email Service: Manages email sent to a subscribers list. Provides a list of subscribed user to send emails to and keeps track of the sent emails.
    * Analytics Service: Keeps track of all actions in the platform. Provides statistics based on user interactions, consumer behaviour and measures marketing campaigns effectiveness.

    Each microservice is built as a separate Python package and runs in its own Docker container. Communication between services is handled through Kafka topics, allowing for scalable and fault-tolerant messaging. The Web application also includes a gateway service, built with Django, that provides a unified API for clients to interact with the microservices.

    Overall, the microservices architecture provides a scalable and flexible platform for building an ecommerce Web application, allowing for easy scaling and maintenance of individual components.

    * Each microservice consists of a different organization depending on its needs
    * Backend microservices are arranged providing the following endpoints:
        #### Users:
            - Login
            - Logout
            - New user registration
            - Recover password
            - Profile page
            - Verify OTP
        #### Cart:
