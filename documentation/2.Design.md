## Architecture
    The E-commerce Web App follows a modern, microservices-based architecture that provides a flexible and scalable platform for online shopping. The app is built using the following technologies:

    * Django Rest Framework: A modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python. Django provides high performance, validation, and easy-to-use asynchronous support.
    * Kafka: A distributed streaming platform that enables real-time communication between services. Kafka provides scalable and fault-tolerant messaging, making it ideal for building microservices architectures.
    * PostgreSQL: A powerful and reliable relational database management system. PostgreSQL provides a flexible data model, transaction support, and advanced features such as JSON storage and full-text search.

    The Web application e-commerce consists of the following microservices:

    * User Service: Manages user authentication and authorization. Provides operations for registering a new user, logging in, managing user accounts, update profile information and OTP validation.
    * Inventory API: Displays products and lets the user explore the galleries and content.
    * Cart: Allows the user to add an item to the shopping cart or remove it. It also allows the preview of the cart content and provides a checkout
    * Order API: Manages the order fullfillment assuing a correct order placement and payment verification, after a successfull process of an order it generates a tracking number for the user.
    * Marketing API: Managed by the marketing team to create marketing campaigns via email, allowing users who gave their consent to be emailed with promotions and discounts. 
    * Analytics API: Keeps track of all user actions in the platform. Provides data to be analyzed and create statistics based on user behaviour and measures marketing campaigns effectiveness.

    Each microservice is built as a separate Python package and runs in its own Docker container. Communication between services is handled through Kafka topics, allowing for scalable and fault-tolerant messaging. The Web application also includes a gateway service, built with Django, that provides a unified API for clients to interact with the microservices.

    Overall, the microservices architecture provides a scalable and flexible platform for building an ecommerce Web application, allowing for easy scaling and maintenance of individual components.

    * Each microservice consists of a different organization depending on its needs
    * Backend microservices are arranged providing the following endpoints:
        #### Users:
            - Login
            - Logout
            - New user registration
